### File Descriptions

#### `face_detection.py`
- Main GUI application
- Face registration and tracking logic
- User interface components
- Multi-threading implementation

#### `data.py`
- SQLite database operations
- User data management
- Image and encoding storage
- Database initialization

#### `requirements.txt`
- List of required Python packages
- Version specifications for compatibility

## üîß Configuration

### Company Name
To change the company name displayed in the application:
```python
# In face_detection.py, line ~330
company_name = "YOUR COMPANY NAME"
```

### Database Location
The SQLite database is stored in the same directory as the application:
```python
# In data.py
DB_PATH = 'faces.db'
```

### Face Detection Threshold
Adjust the face recognition sensitivity:
```python
# In face_detection.py, tracking function
if distance < 30:  # Lower value = more strict matching
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Camera Not Accessible
- **Error**: "Unable to access the camera"
- **Solution**: Check camera permissions and ensure no other application is using the camera

#### 2. Face Not Detected
- **Error**: "No face detected"
- **Solution**: 
  - Use a clear, well-lit photo
  - Ensure the face is clearly visible
  - Try different angles or lighting

#### 3. Employee List Not Showing
- **Issue**: Empty employee list
- **Solutions**:
  - Register at least one employee first
  - Check if the database file exists
  - Verify registration was successful

#### 4. Import Errors
- **Error**: Missing module errors
- **Solution**: Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 5. Database Errors
- **Error**: SQLite database issues
- **Solution**: Delete `faces.db` file and restart the application

### Performance Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-quality, well-lit photos for better recognition
2. **Database Size**: Regularly clean up unused employee records
3. **System Resources**: Close other applications when using face tracking
4. **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting for real-time face detection

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your machine
- **No Network**: The application doesn't require internet connection
- **Privacy**: Employee photos and data remain on your system
- **Access Control**: Implement additional security measures for production use
